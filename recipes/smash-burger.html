    <h3>Description</h3>

        <p>Smash burgers are a beloved twist on the classic American hamburger, prized for their crispy, caramelized crust and juicy interior. The technique is simple yet effective: thin beef patties (usually about 80/20 lean-to-fat ratio) are smashed flat onto a hot griddle or cast-iron skillet using a spatula or pressing tool. This creates maximum contact with the cooking surface, producing a deeply browned, crunchy edge while sealing in juices. Often cooked only on one side before flipping once, smash burgers are topped with melted cheese—typically American—so it cascades over the edges, adding creamy richness. Served on soft, toasted buns with minimal toppings like pickles, onions, ketchup, or a special sauce, the focus remains on the pure beef flavor enhanced by textural contrast.</p>
        <p>Beyond technique, smash burgers celebrate a minimalist philosophy that values simplicity and quality. Because the patties cook fast—usually under two minutes per side—they retain moisture and don’t overcook, making them perfect to prepare in doubles or triples layered on a single bun. Due to the high surface‑area‑to‑volume ratio, each bite delivers a concentrated beefy punch alongside crisp edges, offering a satisfying combination of textures. The smash burger has enjoyed a resurgence in popularity thanks to fast-casual joints and boutique burger spots nationwide, yet it remains easy to replicate at home with minimal equipment—just a heavy skillet, spatula, and freshly ground beef.</p>
