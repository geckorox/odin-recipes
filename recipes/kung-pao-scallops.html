    <h3>Description</h3>

        <p>PF Chang’s Kung Pao Scallops used to be my favorite thing to order (and the chicken lettuce wraps). I pretty much got it every time. We haven’t been to our local PF Chang’s in a long time but I looked at the menu recently and they don’t even have the scallops on the menu anymore.</p>
        <p>I remember the dish well. The things that stood out; the crispy scallops, the sauce, the peanuts and the chilies (that you probably shouldn’t eat but I did).</p>
        <p>Besides the restaurant’s dish, a couple of things inspired this dish. Fresh South Carolina scallops (from Broadwater Shrimp Co.) and a jar of PF Chang’s Kung Pao sauce (from Amazon).</p>
        <p>Full disclosure, this did not turn out as good as PF Chang’s. I probably knew that going in but I hoped I could get the scallops crispy without over cooking. I suspect the restaurant drops them in the fryer. All and all, it was still really good and I’d make it again.</p>
