    <h3>Description</h3>

        <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish that has become a beloved comfort food around the world. Its origins can be traced back to ancient Rome, where layers of pasta and sauce were used in early culinary experiments. However, the modern version we recognize today—with layers of pasta sheets, rich meat sauce, creamy béchamel or ricotta cheese, and melted mozzarella—developed in Italy during the Middle Ages, particularly in the region of Emilia-Romagna.
        </p>
        <p>The heart of traditional lasagna is its slow-simmered ragù, typically made with ground beef or pork, tomatoes, onions, garlic, and herbs like oregano and basil. This sauce is layered between sheets of pasta—either fresh or dried and boiled—alongside generous helpings of cheese. In Northern Italy, béchamel sauce is often used instead of ricotta, giving the dish a velvety texture. Once assembled, the lasagna is baked until golden and bubbling, allowing the flavors to meld into a rich, hearty dish.</p>
        <p>While the classic meat version remains the most well-known, lasagna has inspired countless variations to suit different tastes and dietary preferences. Vegetarian lasagna often includes layers of roasted vegetables like zucchini, eggplant, and spinach, while others incorporate pesto, seafood, or even alternative proteins. Vegan versions substitute dairy and meat with plant-based ingredients, making the dish accessible to a wider audience.</p>
        <p>Lasagna is more than just a meal—it's a symbol of family gatherings, celebrations, and home-cooked tradition. Whether served at a festive holiday table or enjoyed as leftovers the next day, its layers tell a story of culinary heritage and adaptability.</p>
